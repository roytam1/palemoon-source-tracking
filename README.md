# Pale Moon web browser

This is the source code for the Pale Moon web browser, an independent browser derived from Firefox/Mozilla community code. The source tree is
laid out in a "comm-central" style configuration where only the code specific to Pale Moon is kept in this repository.

The shared Goanna Rendering Engine platform source code is referenced here as a git submodule contained in the `platform/` directory and is required to build the application.

## Getting the platform sub-module
`git submodule init && git submodule update`
