# Note about branding

Please take note that these branding files are **protected by copyright and trademarks**. 
Take notice of the conditions set forth in `LICENSE` before building and distributing
any software using _any_ of these branding files in whole or in part. This includes any
unique identifiers that may be present in preference files.

Unofficial branding (in `./unofficial`) is an exception to this; it is stand-alone
temporary branding provided _for convenience of buildability_ and is MPL 2.0 licensed.
You are at all times strongly urged to use this temporary branding only for internal
builds and that that any published software use unique, significantly different names
and graphics. Unofficial branding is overly generic on purpose to encourage proper
branding practices in derivative works.
