# Goanna Run-time Environment (GRE)

This repository holds the code for [Goanna](http://www.moonchildproductions.info/goanna.shtml)-based platform code for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central).

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla sourced code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a maintained platform to be used by XUL
applications.
